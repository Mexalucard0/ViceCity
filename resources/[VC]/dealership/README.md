# esx_CryptoCustoms
Custom Car dealer job based off esx_vehicleshop

Just took esx_vehicleshop and changed events then edited it to work as a full RP custom car dealership, while leaving esx_vehicleshop to do the AI simions cars.

I didn't plan on releasing this but because of some toxic people I am forced to open source this before it hits the script black market or ends up with the wrong credits.

Included:
- CarDealership garage
- Sell custom cars to players
- Have DEALER plate cars for employees
- Bill Player / Sell Car / Buy Car / DEALER plate to employee all in one menu
- Boss can see outstanding bills
- other options for employees/boss
- esx_finanace support
- jsfour-licenseplate support (licenseplate crafting)
- other options for employees/boss
